My first HTML5 game

### About this project
This is my first time creating a game on HTML5. I've learned this through Udemy online course ["Code Your First Game"](https://www.udemy.com/code-your-first-game). The game is created on HTML5 canvas and mostly javascript.

### How to run the game
* Clone or download the repo
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/terngkub/pingpong.git
  ```
* Go to the game directory
* Open game.html in your browser

### How to play
* You're the player on the left, playing against the AI on the right.
* Move your mouse up/down to bounce the ball.
* If the player can't reach the ball, another player get a point.
* Those who get 3 points first wins.
* After the game end, you can click at the screen to start a new game.
* Bonus: The farther from the center of the paddle you bounces, the faster the ball moves.
